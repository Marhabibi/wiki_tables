# TableNET - A knowledge base of Wikipedia tables.

This repository contains the code and necessary resources for building TableNet.

We have uploaded a sample of the [ground-truth data](https://github.com/bfetahu/wiki_tables/blob/master/table_pair_labels_100_sample.tsv) and extracted [table data](https://github.com/bfetahu/wiki_tables/blob/table_data.json.gz). We will release the full dataset upon acceptance of our paper.
